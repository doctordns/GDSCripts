# GDSCripts

A repository of Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia band scripts

## Introduction

This repository contains scripts I use to curate my large collection of Jerry Garcia Band
and Grateful Dead Live shows. 
Most of the shows in the collection are live shows - some of which
I attended (but not anywhere near enough). 
Other 'shows' are sound checks, private get togethers, the acid test tapes, etc. 

The scripts are used to curate my collection and makes some assumptions. 
I have my collection on USB drives in folders. Each folder has a structure (and it is slightly different between JG and GD shows).
