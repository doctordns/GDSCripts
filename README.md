# GDScripts

A repository of Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia band scripts

## Introduction

This repository contains scripts I use to curate my large collection of Jerry Garcia Band
and Grateful Dead Live shows.
Most of the shows in the collection are live shows - some of which
I attended (but not anywhere near enough). 
Other 'shows' are sound checks, private get togethers, the acid test tapes, etc. 

I use these scripts to curate my collection and makes some assumptions about file locations.
I have my collection on USB drives stored in aset of folders. 
The Dead and Jerry shows have a slightly different structure.
In my archive M:\GD holds all the GD shows, with a folder for each show.
For my Jerry shows, "N:\Jerry Garcia" holds the shows with a folder for each year containign the shows for that year.
Of course, these assumptions can be changed.
